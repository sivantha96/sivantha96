# Sivantha Paranavithana  
**Full Stack Engineer · Systems Thinker · Team Builder**

I don’t just write code — I design systems.  
Ones that fail gracefully, scale invisibly, and evolve without chaos.

I build platforms for restaurants — but the patterns are universal:  
asynchronous, transactional, fault-tolerant, human-centered.

**Why I'm Here:**  
To build things that don’t break at 2am.  
To ask better questions, not just write faster code.  
To mentor engineers into architects of simplicity.  
To replace complexity with clarity.

---

Always open to ideas that challenge me.  
You can reach out — but build something cool first.
